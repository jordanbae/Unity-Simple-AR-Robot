# RobotPickup

An internship side-project assigned by [@poppod]
Document: [RobotPickup: Prototype Document(TH)]

## Summary
The purpose of this project is to create a **RobotPickup(AR-based)** project which the robot can pickup 2 different items and place it on the placement. With UI indicating the weight and the amount of the items picked. (The item type can only be picked up once at a time eg. If you picked a box, you can't pick a barrel until you place the box on the box's placement.)

Feel free to look into the code. I tried my best to make the code as clean as possible.

## How to run the app
### Prerequisite
1. Download [Unity 2020.3.7f1]
2. Download the [Image Template].
3. Install [Vuforia Framework] watch tutorials on how to do so.
4. A webcam is needed.
### How to use
1. After setting up everything the next step is running the app.
2. Click Play button in Unity Engine.
3. Aim your camera to the Image Template you prepared.
4. The robot will spawn.
5. Use the arrow shown in your screen to control the robot.
6. You can either pick barrel or box and place them on the correct placement.
7. Enjoy my little project.
